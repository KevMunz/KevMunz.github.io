I am a eletrical engineer major at CSUF and I plan to graduate in 2028.

 ## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

 * Lab 1 

This was the first lab I have ever worked on and was the first experience I had with coding. In this lab I printed my name on the console so when I ran the program it would say “Hello Kevin” and create a newline after. Lab 1 was not difficult whatsoever looking back but at the time I was so confused on how I would write in VSCode and was worried that I was not doing right. Once I finally got it to work I felt content and happy that I managed to write my first code ever even through all the trial and error. That experience prepared me for what was to come and was the introduction of me coding programs. 

* Lab 6, part 2

This was also one of my favorite labs because I think this was the first  time I used the data type bool to either return true or false if the condition statements were true. Not only did we compare variables but the subject that we were comparing was a deck of cards which is something that I did not think we can do in our codes. This program was really fun to do because it was connected to a topic that I was interested in which was playing cards and got me thinking if I could create a game with my own rules regarding blackjack. In this code we just recreated the blackjack rules (a small amount) and used bool to check whether the cards had the right amount of points that they would have in the real game. 

* Lab 7

I would say out of all the labs this was my favorite one by far because it is something that could be useful to people or me for that instance in the real world. In this lab we had to look at parking signs and use if statements to check whether the conditions are true or false. The purpose of this program was for people to type in the day, hour, and street name to check if they were allowed to park there. When they would type in those arguments the program would return either true (they could park there) or false (they could not). This one really stood out to me because it could be helpful to society and inspired me to create apps that would help people in real life.
